= II. STARTUP INSTRUCTIONS =

The file README.txt contains information on how to start the product.

= III. UPGRADE NOTES =

The upgrade procedure is only guaranteed and tested to be transparent from the previous maintenance version (x.y.z from x.y.z-1). So, we recommend to apply upgrade procedures for all versions between your current and the target one.
However, if you still insist on skipping versions, we strongly advise to read all upgrade notes of the versions you are skipping to see if your project is impacted by any previous upgrade procedure.

== Upgrading from Platform 4.2.1 to 4.3.0-RC1 ==

* Prepare bundle:
** If eXo Platform is connected to a populated organizational data source, Organization Integration Service must be activated so that the data are synchronized. Please refer to chapter 7 "LDAP Integration" in Administrator Guide for the detail.
** Go to $PLATFORM-4.3.0-RC1-TOMCAT_HOME/gatein/conf/ folder (Tomcat bundle) or $PLATFORM-4.3.0—RC1-JBOSS_HOME/standalone/configuration/gatein/ folder (Jboss bundle).
** Rename upgrade-4.2.1-to-4.3.0—RC1-sample.properties to upgrade.properties
* Start server. The upgrade will be run automatically.
* Stop server.
* Remove/Rename the file upgrade.properties
* Restart the server. You're ready.

=== Disable-user feature ===

- Notice that you need to upgrade user database only if you use disable-user feature with PicketlinkIDM organization service implementation, for other implementation such as: jdbc implementation, you don't need to active the upgrade plugin for upgrading user data.
- If you don't want the “disable-user” feature (so you don't need to upgrade your user database when using PicketlinkIDM), you can add this to exo.properties configuration file
exo.disable.user.activated=false. The feature will be hidden from PLF, and the disable-user upgrade plugin is also ignored
